### Setting EE_hands to use either hands as master
If you define `EE_HANDS` in your `config.h`, you will need to set the
EEPROM for the left and right halves.

The EEPROM is used to store whether the
half is left handed or right handed. This makes it so that the same firmware
file will run on both hands instead of having to flash left and right handed
versions of the firmware to each half. To flash the EEPROM file for the left
half run:
```
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P $(COM_PORT) -c avr109 -U eeprom:w:"./quantum/split_common/eeprom-lefthand.eep"
// or the equivalent in dfu-programmer

```
and similarly for right half
```
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P $(COM_PORT) -c avr109 -U eeprom:w:"./quantum/split_common/eeprom-righthand.eep"
// or the equivalent in dfu-programmer
```

NOTE: replace `$(COM_PORT)` with the port of your device (e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0`)

After you have flashed the EEPROM, you then need to set `EE_HANDS` in your config.h, rebuild the hex files and reflash.

Note that you need to program both halves, but you have the option of using
different keymaps for each half. You could program the left half with a QWERTY
layout and the right half with a Colemak layout using bootmagic's default layout option.
Then if you connect the left half to a computer by USB the keyboard will use QWERTY and Colemak when the
right half is connected.
